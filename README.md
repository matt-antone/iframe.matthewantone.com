## What is a modular scale?

> A modular scale is a list of values that share the same relationship. These values are often used to size type and create a sense of harmony in a design. Proportions within modular scales are all around us from the spacing of the joints on our fingers to branches on trees. These natural proportions have been used since the time of the ancient Greeks in architecture and design and can be a tremendously helpful tool to leverage for web designers.

Bugo uses Modularscale's Sass Library. https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass

## Customizing Your Website

Bugo Site uses the Bugo Origin Theme. All the SASS varaibles for Origin have been duplicated in ```/src/sass/variables```.

1. Start the server ```# npm start```
2. Modify the values in ```/src/sass/variables```
3. Save the SASS file
4. Open a browser to http://localhost:1313 to see your changes.

## Generate Sample Content

Bugo Site offers the ability to add sample content to work with. This allows you to build a site without having content first.
